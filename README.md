# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
If you run the backend app first you should use other port
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Usage
In your browser type http://localhost:3001/ (with the port you are using to run the front-end app)
You can choose to visualize metris gruped by days, hours or minutes.
Also you can create your own metrics

## The challenge

We want a Front-end + Backend application that allows you to post and visualize metrics. Each metric will have a Timestamp, name, and value. The metrics will be shown in a timeline and must show averages per minute/hour/day. The metrics will be persisted in the database.

You can find the Backend application in https://github.com/edgarbarrero/metrics-backend
